# Juce-Plugins

This is a repository of audio plugins made in C++ using the Juce Framework.

Much inspiration has been taken from The Audio Programmer on Youtube.

His channel can be found here:

Since I'm using Reaper on Windows for debugging, the plugin format is VST3.

The completed plugin builds are in the VST3_Plugins folder.

My ultimate goal for this is to be able to mix an entire song using only plugins I created.

# Juce-Plugins

This is a repository of audio plugins made in C++ using the Juce Framework.

The Juce website is here:

Much inspiration has been taken from The Audio Programmer on Youtube.

Since I'm using Reaper on Windows for testing, the plugin format is VST3.

The completed plugin builds are in the VST3_Plugins folder.

Since I'm primarily a Pro Tools user, I will hopefully build them as AAX at some point.

My ultimate goal for this is to be able to mix an entire song using only plugins I created.

These are the plugins I think are necessary (though I'm not sure how many will be doable):

* <s>Phase Inversion</s>
* <s>Metering</s> and Spectrum
* <s>Filter (highpass and lowpass)</s>
* <s>Parametric Equalizer</s>
* Compressor (with Sidechain)
* Limiter
* Clipper
* Distortion
* Delay
* Reverb

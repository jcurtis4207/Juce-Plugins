# Juce-Plugins

This is a collection of audio plugins made in C++ using the [Juce](https://juce.com) Framework.

Much inspiration has been taken from [The Audio Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKb02FsH4WH4X_2xhIoJ1A) on Youtube.

Since I'm using Reaper on Windows for testing, the plugin format is VST3.

The completed plugin builds are in the VST3_Plugins folder.

Since I'm primarily a Pro Tools user, I will hopefully build them as AAX at some point.

My ultimate goal for this is to be able to mix an entire song using only plugins I created.

These are the plugins I think are necessary (though I'm not sure how many will be doable):

* <s>Phase Inversion</s>
* <s>Metering</s> and Spectrum
* <s>Filter (highpass and lowpass)</s>
* <s>Parametric Equalizer</s>
* Compressor (with Sidechain)
* Limiter
* Clipper
* Distortion
* Delay
* Reverb
